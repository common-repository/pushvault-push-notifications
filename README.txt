== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does it work? =
When a user enters your website, the plugin checks if it is a first time visit and have the webnotifications allowed or blocked for this site. It does so by checking if there are any cookies or data stored in the users browsers (in compliance with EU cookie law).
If the plugin is not able to detect the user as "active", a notice will be shown to the user encouraging him to allow notifications from the site. He can choose to click "allow" or "disallow".
If user clicks "disallow", you can choose when try again asking to activate. If user return back before that time limit, the message will not appear.

= Can I change the subscribe prompt message? =
Of course!, you can change not only message but even the complete style.

Pushvault is free at all, so you do not need any trial. You can see our [legal terms](https://pushvault.com/cdn/pushvault_legalterms.pdf) about the rights and responsabilities you asume using our service.
